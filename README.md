## Description
This is a client-side React application that utilizes the GitHub API to serve as a candidate search application. A GitHub user's profile information is rendered to the screen, and users are able to reject or save each profile that comes up. Users can navigate to a potential candidates page where any profiles they saved will be displayed together in a table, and the user may further reject any of the saved profiles. The application is deployed to Render and utilizes React and TypeScript.
